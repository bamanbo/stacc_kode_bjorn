## Task description
Here you can describe what tasks you decided to solve.
> Please provide a short description of your project.

I chose to focus on the frontend and UX/design tasks. The UX idea is centered on gamification, wherein the amount of real money you save in real life determines the prices that your pre-made character in your reputable bank may make. You can see what I kind of imagine it to look like in the Figma section. 

I made the decision to create an interactive bank account for the front end so that you could see what it might look like in real life. Here users could set objectives, view their savings, and compare their account to that of other users. I illustrated this with graphs.

## How to run
For example ***yarn start***
> Remember to package all dependencies!

Open the figma link and press play in the right corner. To see which buttons to interact with, left-click outside of the figma frame. A blue box will appear.

If that does not work, I have sent you some PDFs in chronological order. They are not interactive, sadly.

To run the HTML, press bank_login.html and create a made-up user. It does not have to be anything special. Only the "Oversikt", "Sparem√•l" and "Konto" parts work. If I had more time I would try to make something out of the other tabs.

## Comments
Comments regaring design choices, decisions, or anything at all.

An interactive bank app where you are your own character and can earn prices based on your own saving decisions appeals to me a lot. When it came to the "create your own character in your bank" section, I was influenced by Snapchat. This is known as gamification, and I firmly think that it will make saving money less tedious. To make it more fun, I also chose to include graphs where you can view the savings of your friends. Who can save the most money the fastest? The fact that your character can earn prizes and pimp out to look better than your pals is also a really great feature. Competition will bring out the wish to save more!
